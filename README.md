# Asynchronous-Assignment-Tasks

*Asynchronous Function Assignment*

*Overview*🌟💫✨

In this assignment, you will implement a set of asynchronous functions to simulate real-world scenarios. You will work with promises, setTimeout, and async/await to handle asynchronous behavior. This assignment aims to help you understand and master asynchronous programming concepts in JavaScript.

*Features*✨✨:

- Implements asynchronous functions using promises and setTimeout
- Uses async/await syntax for readable and maintainable code
- Handles errors appropriately using try/catch blocks and .catch methods
- Includes unit tests for each function using Jest
- Follows ESLint rules and guidelines for code quality and consistency

*Objectives*✍️✒️:

- Understand the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript
- Learn how to work with promises and setTimeout
- Master the use of async/await syntax
- Develop error handling skills using try/catch blocks and .catch methods
- Write unit tests for asynchronous code using Jest
- Follow best practices for code quality and consistency using ESLint

*Usage*📝📝:

- Run the code using Node.js (e.g. `node assignment.js`)
- Run the unit tests using Jest (e.g. `jest assignment.test.js`)
- Use a code editor or IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code) to write and debug the code

*Benefits*💡💡:

- Asynchronous programming skills are essential for modern web development
- Mastering promises and async/await syntax makes your code more readable and maintainable
- Error handling skills ensure that your code is robust and reliable
- Writing unit tests ensures that your code is testable and maintainable
- Following best practices for code quality and consistency makes your code more efficient and scalable

*Requirements*🌟💫

- Implement the `fetchData` and `processData` functions using promises and setTimeout
- Implement the `executeSequentially` function using async/await and promises
- Log the results of each function call in the order they are executed
- Handle errors appropriately using try/catch blocks and .catch methods

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
