# Asynchronous-Assignment-Tasks
** What is Asynchronous function?💡✍️👇👇
📒📜📙An asynchronous function is a type of function that performs its operations in the background, without blocking the main thread of execution. It allows other tasks to be executed simultaneously, improving the overall performance and responsiveness of the program.

In JavaScript, asynchronous functions are typically defined using the following techniques:

1. Callbacks: Passing a callback function as an argument to the asynchronous function, which is executed when the operation is complete.
2. Promises: Returning a Promise object that resolves or rejects with the result of the operation.
3. Async/Await: Using the async and await keywords to write asynchronous code that appears synchronous.

Asynchronous functions are commonly used for tasks such as:

- Network requests (e.g., fetching data from an API)
- Database queries
- File I/O operations
- Timer-based operations (e.g., scheduling a task to run after a certain delay)

The key characteristics of asynchronous functions are:

- Non-blocking: They do not block the main thread of execution.
- Concurrent: They allow other tasks to be executed simultaneously.
- Callback-based: They often rely on callbacks or promises to handle the result of the operation.

By using asynchronous functions, we can write more efficient and scalable code that improves the overall user experience.

*Asynchronous Function Assignment*

*Overview*🌟💫✨

In this assignment, you will implement a set of asynchronous functions to simulate real-world scenarios. You will work with promises, setTimeout, and async/await to handle asynchronous behavior. This assignment aims to help you understand and master asynchronous programming concepts in JavaScript.

*Features*✨✨:

- Implements asynchronous functions using promises and setTimeout
- Uses async/await syntax for readable and maintainable code
- Handles errors appropriately using try/catch blocks and .catch methods
- Includes unit tests for each function using Jest
- Follows ESLint rules and guidelines for code quality and consistency

*Objectives*✍️✒️:

- Understand the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript
- Learn how to work with promises and setTimeout
- Master the use of async/await syntax
- Develop error handling skills using try/catch blocks and .catch methods
- Write unit tests for asynchronous code using Jest
- Follow best practices for code quality and consistency using ESLint

*Usage*📝📝:

- Run the code using Node.js (e.g. `node assignment.js`)
- Run the unit tests using Jest (e.g. `jest assignment.test.js`)
- Use a code editor or IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code) to write and debug the code

*Benefits*💡💡:

- Asynchronous programming skills are essential for modern web development
- Mastering promises and async/await syntax makes your code more readable and maintainable
- Error handling skills ensure that your code is robust and reliable
- Writing unit tests ensures that your code is testable and maintainable
- Following best practices for code quality and consistency makes your code more efficient and scalable

*Requirements*🌟💫

- Implement the `fetchData` and `processData` functions using promises and setTimeout
- Implement the `executeSequentially` function using async/await and promises
- Log the results of each function call in the order they are executed
- Handle errors appropriately using try/catch blocks and .catch methods

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
